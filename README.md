# Moonshot

In this project we’re going to build an app that lets users learn about the missions and astronauts that formed NASA’s Apollo space program. You’ll get more experience with Codable, but more importantly you’ll also work with scroll views, navigation, and much more interesting layouts.

## Features

Today you have five topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about container relative frames, ScrollView, NavigationLink, and more.

- Resizing images to fit the available space
- How ScrollView lets us work with scrolling data
- Pushing new views onto the stack using NavigationLink
- Working with hierarchical Codable data
- How to lay out views in a scrolling grid
